### Assignment overview 

This assignment covers concepts involved in working with non-numeric (character and factor) and covers the following key areas:
#### 1. Writing R functions 
In R and programming in general, functions are a powerful tool and are used to incorporate sets of instructions that we may need to use repeatedly. They can also be used when instructions are complex and are better self-contained in a sub program and called when needed. Simply put - a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. To note is that functions are R objects of class "function"; they are first class objects, which means that they can be treated much like any other R object. They can also be passed as arguments to other functions, they can be nested to allow for the definition of a function inside another function. The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated. 

Functions are created using the function() directive using the genetal syntax below:
```r 
f <- function(<arguments>) {
        ## Do something interesting
}
```

#### 2. Working with [regular expressions](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf) and character data
Regular expressions are a concise and flexible tool for describing patterns in strings and are heavily used for string matching / replacing. Many string functions are available in base R as well as in the `stringr package`.

**Example usage**

```r
courses <-  c("STAT545, STAT547M, STAT540 are awesome courses")
str_detect(courses, "BIOF501")
#[1] FALSE
```


#### 3. Working with purrr, list-columns, nested data frames
Purrr is a relatively new R package that works with magrittr to allow us express complex operations by combining simple code  pieces in a standard way. It enhances Râ€™s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. `map()`functions are a good example of functional programming which allow for replacement of many for-loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read - examples will be shown herein.
